## v0.3.0

**May 23, 2025**

This release primarily focuses on improving support for upsert behavior during system initialization. A few targeted changes were introduced to ensure initialization paths handle upserts more consistently. However, this release is not intended for general usage, as Paralus cannot be fully operated using this version due to these initialization constraints.
